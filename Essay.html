		<h2>ASSIGNMENT_2 ESSAY</h2>

		<section>
			<p>
				User experience or UX design is the experiences a user (person engaging with an object) has in a specific context. There are two types of experiences a user can have 
				when engaging with something like a website, the singular experience and the cumulative experience. The singular experience comes from the user's direct interaction with
				the object while the cumulative experience is a result of all the interactions they have leading up to and after interacting with the object that directly alters their 
				experience with the object (Peta, 2023). There are a number of ethical concerns that arise when a designer is creating a user experience like the accessibility of the 
				UX, the existential values, benevolent intent, and the misdirected intent. In this essay I aim to evaluate the UX and UI (the aesthetic elements of a website that a 
				user actively engages with) ethics of Vodacom’s, a South African mobile and internet service provider.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Vodacom website limits the amount of freedom users have in changing the way they interact with the website, this takes away almost all of the users agency. For the 
				purpose of the website though, to sell products and services, this is fine as the user will not likely to be engaging with it constantly but instead to make purchases 
				and continue with their daily routine. It is in the interest of Vodacom and their UX designers to instead limit the amount of choices a user has to make to reduce user 
				errors. This is done to make the website as “linear, reduced and efficient” (Yonatan, 2017) as possible. The two types of user errors are slips and mistakes: slips are 
				when users “intend to perform one action but but end up doing another” (Peta, 2023) while mistakes are intentional errors where the user often has incomplete or 
				incorrect information about a task that leads them to develop a way of thinking that does not match how the interface works or requires of them (Peta 2023). Slips are 
				had to prevent because you can not accurately predict how a user will subconsciously carry out a slip but Vodacom’s UI is large and often colour coded so the user 
				should be able to pick up on a slip before they click on the wrong product or service because of how large the UI (text and images) on the Vodacom website is. The 
				website uses user limitations to reduce the amount of mistakes a user can make. There are only a handful of choices a user can make on the Vodacom page at any given 
				time (especially on the home page); they can click on a product or they can scroll down or up on the homepage. This greatly reduces the mistakes a user can make.
				<br>
				<br>
				The benevolent intent of Vodacom is either not initially evident or not present at all. The website is not concerned with placing the needs of the user above the 
				company's goals of selling products although it does allow the user to choose or search for products that best suit their needs. This can be found under the shop and 
				survive sections of the website but are slightly out of the way, forcing the user to search for these options. The Vodacom website's primary goal is to sell products 
				and services and it places this goal above everything else. The website uses persuasive design to “nudge” users towards certain decisions that may not be in their best 
				interest (Kiess, 2019). The website uses colour to highlight certain products to make them seem more appealing, for instance on its homepage it highlights phones that 
				depreciate in value faster than ones that maintain their value for longer periods of time. This is not necessarily harmful to the user but the phones are paid for 
				(by the user) at a fixed price often over 36 months. This means that the user would have paid far more for their phone than they should have. Another way Vodacom nudges
				its users to buy their products is by allowing them to choose between paying once-off (almost all once off payments are presented a been on discount) or month payments
				but the website does not initially tell the user the length of time they would be paying for the phone until far alter in the payment process. This makes the product
				more desirable but at the cost of limiting the information given to the user.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Vodacom website also makes use of certain dark UX patterns that nudge the users into making bad decisions like its use of additional charges that it only tell you 
				about before you purchase the product, making it easy to purchase products but at the cost of paying for the item over long periods of time, and making items look 
				exclusive and desirable. The website automatically adds an insurance monthly payment on all contract items (items you pay over a fixed length of time, often 24 or 36 
				months). They add this payment by default and only let you know of it at the end of the page just before you click on the ‘start checkout’ button. It also makes online 
				purchases very easy, although there are thorough steps to insure you can make the payments which is good, so the user can end up into a contract with vodacom for more 
				than a year with no tangible way of exiting it. On many of the website's pages they also make items they want the user to buy look desirable. They advertise new items 
				in large boxes that draw the users attention to them, offer a surprising amount of items on discount and in some cases offer free items with your purchase even though 
				they are making you pay monthly instalments for items that depreciate at fast rates.
				<br>
				<br>
				Vodacom's use of UX and UI design is all centred around making users buy their products. They try to nudge the user into entering long contracts that are not 
				necessarily beneficial to the user. They use dark UX design to accomplish this like the use of exaggerating an item's desirability and adding purchases on items that
				look affordable. The items and contracts they want the users to pay for are often the largest image on the page and are highlighted in red making them look like the 
				better option. The website does reduce the amount of mistakes a user can possibly make by limiting the choices they have to make at any given time but as a whole the 
				design of the website tends to lead towards unethical design as the entire goal of the business and website is to get the user to give Vodacom money.
