					<h3>IxD Process:</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Goal Alignment:</em>
						<br>
						My goals for this website were to make a simple and clean UI with an easy to understand interface that clearly shows what content I am trying to display 
						(photography). I wanted them to easily navigate through the homepage, seeing the photos (most important) and the menu on the left of the page if they wanted more
						information. My users are people interested in working with me in the future with photography. They would come to my website to view my portfolio work and find 
						a way to contact me.

						<br><br>
						<em>User Flow:</em>
						<br>
						On each page of the website the user is intended to notice the content of the page first and then their attention is supposed to move towards the Home button (DW)
						and the menu below it. Especially on the home and portfolio pages, the user is intended to focus on the images and content of the page. The user is expected to 
						scroll the pages after looking over at the menu and home button. I tried to encourage this behaviour from the user by making each pages content more noticeable 
						while the menu is smaller and but still legible.

						<br><br>
						<em>Interface Elements:</em>
						<br>
						I used buttons primarily as interface elements. The buttons are what is used to navigate the website, most elements of each page are buttons that link to 
						different parts of the website.

						<br><br>
						<em>Style Process Documentation:</em>
						<br>
						 I pulled much of my visual aesthetic from the website YEAR0001 for the swedish recording label:
						 <br>
						 <a href="https://year0001.com" target="_blank">https://year0001.com</a>
					
						 <br><br>
						The font I chose is Nanum Gothic Coding because of its clean and easily readable style that I found on the Google fonts page. It is also somewhat similar to 
						the font used on the website I am taking most of my inspiration from, Year0001. The font typeface lends to its readability and the spacing between the letters 
						makes each word legible. I used a black font because it contrasts well with the white background. When needed for extra emphasis I would highlight the text in a 
						light grey.
					
						<br><br>
						Font:<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic+Coding#styles" targert="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nanum+Gothic+Coding#styles</a></p> 
					
						I used a very open design with a large amount of negative space. I wanted to focus more on the photography in the website though so I made the images a lot 
						larger to bring more attention to them. The font I used, Nanum Gothic Coding, was inspired by the one used by YEAR0001 in its feel. I went for a minimalistic 
						colour palette (black and white) to only focus on the images and to make all the text stand out adequately.

						<br><br>
						<em>Style Guide:</em>
						<br>
						My goal: A sleek and retro-futuristic visual design that harnesses early 2000s nostalgia with a breadth of modern design sentiments.

					<h3>Implementation Notes:</h3>
					<p>
						My website is mostly black text on a white background, there are some exceptions where there is highlighted text. Because of this I attempted to centre my 
						aesthetics around blocking. The website's code reflects this by breaking down each heading and paragraph types  that follow a hierarchical order (in some cases 
						there are multiple types of paragraphs depending on the amount of text and the type of information). There are aspects of the semantic markup that could be 
						cleaned up like the excessive amounts of div tags for things that are effectively doing the same or very similar things.
