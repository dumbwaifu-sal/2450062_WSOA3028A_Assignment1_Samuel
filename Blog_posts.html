					<h3>Week 1 Blog Post:</h3>
		
					<p>
					<em>Setting Up GitHub:</em>
					<br>
					When I first downloaded GitHub and tried to wrap my head around it without any outside information it seemed unnecessarily obtuse. After watching some of the videos 
					uploaded to Ulwazi explaining how to navigate around GitHub and GitHub desktop, its uses and functionality became a little more clearer. I did still watch further, somewhat
					more concise, YouTube videos to wrap my head around GitHub (specifically the desktop version) to make sure I understood what most of the relevant features were meant to do 
					and to start learning how to use it more collaboratively (my group in another course discussed using GitHub for our project). After an hour or so of messing around with 
					GitHub and following some tutorials on how to use it I was far more familiar with the program.

					<br><br>
					<em>Reflections On the Reading:</em>
					<br>
					The Library of Babel covers ideas on human existence, namely our need for a greater meaning, order in a seemingly chaotic world, and how our pursiuits of knowledge and 
					meaning are pointless. The reading creates a ficitional reality where the universe and everything that goes on in it is analogous to an endless library with books stored 
					in heaxagonal chambers that have endless variations on the alphabet. These chambers extending, seemingly, endlessly in all directions store every book about every subject 
					that could possibly exist. This includes every event and idea in every possible language with as many variations of these as possible. Humans in this infinite library 
					search endlessly for different knowledge (sometimes variations of the same thing) in order to find some higher meaning for the library, their own existences or they just 
					embrace the randomness of the library. The short story tries to get us to reflect on our own attempts to find meaning, order, and higher power in the randomness of our own 
					universe through religion, science, philosophy etc. It also makes us contemplate the difference between meaningless information and knowledge and the infinite meanings that 
					can be stored in the meaningless information. The library has notable similarities to the internet and how easy it is to find information anywhere and everywhere in near 
					endless variations but there could still be a lack of knowledge gained. The internet, like the library, can store near infinite amouonts of information but that information 
					is meaningless to us if it's hard to access or understand.

					<br><br>
					<em>Your Goals for the Course:</em>
					<br>
					My goals for the course are to fully engage with the theory and learn enough of the coding language for web development so that I begin web design and start experimenting 
					with UI/UX.

				<h3>Week 2 Blog Post:</h2>

				<p>
				<em>Starting With HTML:</em>
				<br>
				HTML, unlike programming languages like C#, are a lot easier to grasp for beginners from my expeerience. The language is a lot more straight forward with its naming that 
				makes it easier to get into. The hardest part of using html for me is creating clean code that is easy to navigate/read and that follows a clear heirarchy. 

				<br><br>
				<em>Reflection On the Readings:</em>
				<br>
				The "why You Should Choose HTML5" reading introduced me to sectioning, section and article tags, and the pros of cons of each (mainly the section tag cons). The article tag 
				will be useful when I begin coding for my website in that it will help streamline my workflow so I do not have to constantly be thinking about placing the proper heading 
				tags but i ca instead nest heading tags in an article and a heirarchy of headings will form. The readings also discussed how sectioning can help screen reader users better 
				navigate your website through its clear indication of where a piece of information begins and ends like a summary of an article.

				<br><br>
				<em>Reflection On Internet Histories:</em>
				<br>
				It is interesting to see how the internet developed into the large interconnected web of information it is today and how much of this development was a result of necessity: 
				people wanted to archive information they could not access on the internet, creating services that could be accessed more easily online, ways to find information faster etc.

				<h3>Week 3 Blog Post:</h3>

				<p>
				<em>Website Development Progress:</em>
				<br>
				This week we learned how to style or html code using a style sheet, CSS. I have begun to explore possible ways I can style my html code to by trying out different font 
				family I can use in my website and how the different headings could possibly look. While doing this I have begun wireframing possible designs for the websites Homepage, 
				Blog Section, and Design section. It is interesting how it is considered good practice for html code to be styled in a style sheet instead of the html file. This, I think, 
				is to declutter the semantic markup, for accesibility (as in the case of screen readers), and for search engine optimisation. 

				<br><br>
				<em>Reflection Of Reading:</em>
				<br>
				Convention is important to understand how to communicate ideas to users with regards to UI/UX. Understanding how to use current conventions and manipulate them can help 
				you create a specific user experience unique to but built on established ideas and methods of communication. I believe understanding how a user interprets different visual 
				elements on your website will help you better guide their experiences and figure out the heirarchy of importance for that they subconsciously aknowledge.

				<br><br>
				<em>Thoughts On Supplementary Material:</em>
				<br>
				I think the supplementary material is generally helpful in broadening my understanding of the content covered in the lectures and readings. It can sometimes be time
				consuming to go through the lecture content and readings and supplimentary content but on the occasion where I can not fully grasp what is expected of me each week, I will
				go through the supplementary work because it is generally helpfull.

				<h3>Week 4 Blog Post:</h3>

				<p>
				<em>Website Development Progress:</em>
				<br>
				This week we started learning JavaScript. It is closer to C#, a programming language I have some familiarity with but do not enjoy using, than it is to html. I hope that as 
				I begin to incorporate JavaScript into my website, I wont find it as frustrating as I did with other languages. I've continued refinining my wireframes for the websitem, 
				beginning to settle on a final design. I've added quite a bit of content into my html scripts but have not done much to style as I'm still working on my wireframes. 
				Although I have styled my website yet I am trying to adhere to a clear heirarchy in my html code.

				<br><br>
				<em>Reflection On Wireframes:</em>
				<br>
				The reading "The Basic Principles of User Interface Design" put my wireframes and their current efficiency into perspective. Most of my pages do not give usefull feedback
				on where the user is at the moment (i.e what page), for example: the blog posts are named "dev blogs" in the left hand menu while the page's header says "Blog Posts", this
				is confusing and and does not give the user clear feedback. While there are changes needed for consistent and clear feedback I think I did well to adhere to common web 
				design conventions (in terms of the page layouts). I've kept the navigation menu on the left of the screen as well as th homepage button.

				<br><br>
				<em>Reflection On the Readings:</em>
				<br>
				The readings on User Interface are effectively about making the UI as accesible and as easy as possible for the user to interact with it. The UI should be invisible and 
				should not hinder the user from finding the information they need. An important thing to remember is that the UI should not get in th way of the users goals; the user 
				should not need to think too hard on how to navigate around your website nor should they take longer than three clicks to find information.
